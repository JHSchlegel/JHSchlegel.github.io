Hi there! I'm Jan, a Master's student in Statistics at ETH Zurich with a passion for machine learning, healthcare applications, and probabilistic modeling. My journey combines rigorous academic training in statistics with hands-on experience in research and data analysis. I thrive on solving complex problems and am particularly interested in the intersection of machine learning and healthcare. With a strong foundation in both theoretical statistics and practical implementation, I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and contribute to meaningful projects. Currently seeking opportunities in machine learning and data science - let's connect!
