Hi there! I'm Jan, a statistician and product manager based in Zurich. I recently completed my Master's in Statistics at ETH Zurich, specializing in probabilistic AI, high-dimensional statistics, and causality. My work focuses on understanding and improving how machine learning systems make decisions—from interpreting generative models to building robust methods for high-stakes applications like climate forecasting and reinsurance.

When I'm not working on difficult (for me) problems, you'll find me running in the gym, swimming, building PCs, or getting lost (intentionally) in GeoGuessr.
